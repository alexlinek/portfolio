        <h5>Strong PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS skills and Sass</h5>
        <h6>PHP</h6>
        <p>Well-versed in PHP, especially in the context of WordPress. While I was working at <a href="https://drawittoknowit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draw It To Know It</a>, I delved into PHP a bit deeper, utilizing the <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Symfony</a> framework and <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twig</a> templating engine.</p>
        <h6>JavaScript</h6>
        <p>The bulk of my experience is with jQuery, though I am familiar with ES6+ and can write vanilla JavaScript if needed. I love working with cool animation libraries like <a href="https://greensock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSAP</a> when the project calls for it. I have some expeience with React (also from Draw It To Know It), and I'm currently in the process of building my new + improved portfolio with Gatsby.</p>
        <h6>HTML & CSS/Sass</h6>
        <p>I'm well-versed in HTML5 and CSS3, as well as preprocessors such as Sass. You can read some of my thoughts on the importance of semantic HTML in this <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.</p>

        <h5>Familiarity with Git</h5>
        <p>I use Git for version control on every project, even when I'm the only developer. Typically I use a GUI like SourceTree or GitHub Desktop, but I am also comfortable with command line. I have frequently hopped in and out of projects with other developers.</p>

        <h5>A keen eye for and innate understanding of design, and the ability to translate Sketch and Principle designs into pixel-perfect, responsive code</h5>
        <p>I have a BFA in Graphic Design and started my career as a designer. While at Draw It To Know It and Brevity, I divided my time between design and development. I am comfortable with most design programs and, more importantly, comfortable with asking designers for their input.</p>
