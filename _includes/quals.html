        <h5>Extensive experience with content management systems, particularly WordPress.</h5>
        <p>For the past couple of years I’ve been developing custom themes exclusively with WordPress. I am well acquainted the various aspects of theme development, including things like template structure, plugins, and of course searching the ol’ Codex.</p>

        <h5>Code semantic, standards-compliant HTML/CSS.</h5>
        <p>I’ve been writing HTML and CSS for almost 10 years now. I am well-versed in HTML5 and CSS3, as well as preprocessors such as Sass and LESS. Additionally, you can read what I have to say about the importance of semantic HTML in this <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>

        <h5>Solid background with Javascript and AJAX using jQuery.</h5>
        <p>The bulk of my experience is with jQuery, but I have a basic understanding of vanilla Javascript that I can implement if the solution calls for it. I have some expeience working with <a href="https://reactjs.com/" target="_blank">React</a> from my time at <a href="https://drawittoknowit.com/" target="_blank">Draw It To Know It</a>, and I recently started learning React Native. I'm familiar with AJAX, integrating with 3rd party APIs, and accessing JSON files. After all, reloading entire pages is lame.</p>

        <h5>Solid understanding of PHP.</h5>
        <p>Most of my PHP knowledge comes from what's necessary to build WordPress themes. However, while I was working at <a href="https://drawittoknowit.com/" target="_blank">Draw It To Know It</a>, I delved into PHP a bit deeper, utilizing the <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a> framework and <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/" target="_blank">Twig</a> templating engine.</p>

        <h5>HTML Email best practices.</h5>
        <p>I have a thorough understanding of HTML email best practices and experience with tools such as MailChimp, Constant Contact, and Litmus. At Brevity, I spearheaded the implementation of <a href="http://mjml.io" target="_blank">MJML</a> in our email development process in order to create emails that were feature-rich, compliant, and easily customized. It also significantly reduced our development time. Read my love letter to MJML in this <a href="http://seekbrevity.com/mjml-simplified-email-marketing/" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>
